wording is unclear - "Has created an application that is independent of the node install on the candidates machine"
typo in "Has the ablity to hot-reload based on changes"
lifecycle question should be better worded
maybe split into two?
unsure of how comprehensive my answers needed to be (specifically on the state question)
