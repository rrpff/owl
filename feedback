hedgehog:
wording is unclear - "Has created an application that is independent of the node install on the candidates machine"
typo in "Has the ablity to hot-reload based on changes"
lifecycle question should be better worded
maybe split into two?
unsure of how comprehensive my answers needed to be (specifically on the state question)

fox:
criteria around explaining why you should use the key prop
something around where your onclick handlers should sit in the class
explain/demonstrate how to structure a react component class/function? i.e. where handlers/lifecycle functions/state should sit and be defined/changed
